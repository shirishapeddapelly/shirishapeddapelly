    ////NOTES//// //Differences blw == and === // The == operator does the
    typeconversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the ===
    operatorcompares the values as well as the data types of the operands *The
    == and === operands are used to compare if two values are equal. ->The ==
    operand loosely compares two values, thus it can be used in cases where the
    data type of the operand isn't important. For e.g., imagine a form entry
    where you've asked students their roll no. It is possible that some will
    enter it in string form and some in number form. In such cases, we can use
    the == operator to verify the data without the database. ->The === operand
    strictly compares two values, thus it is used in the places where the data
    type of the operand is important. Imagine an online coding contest, where an
    answer is a number in string format. In that case, we'll use the ===
    operator to compare and validate answers.

    //NaN property in js// *NaN is a property of the global object. In other
    words, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of NaN is
    Not-A-Number — the same as the value of Number. ->If NaN is involved in any
    mathematical operation, the result is also NaN.When NaN is one of the
    operands of any relational comparison (>, <, >=, <=),the result is always
    false. NaN compares unequal (via ==, !=, ===, and !==)to any other value —
    including to another NaN value. ->The initial value of NaN is Not-A-Number —
    the same as the value of Number.NaN. In modern browsers, NaN is a
    non-configurable, non-writable property.

    ////Call by Value Vs Call by Reference in JavaScript //// *Call by Value:
    Suppose there is a variable named “a”. Now, we store a primitive
    value(boolean, integer,float, etc) in the variable “a”. Let us store an
    integer value in “a”, Let a=5. Now the variable “a” stores 5 and has an
    address location where that primitive value sits in memory. Now, suppose we
    copy the value of “a” in “b” by assignment (a=b). Now, “b” points to a new
    location in memory, containing the same data as variable “a”. Thus, a=b=5
    but both points to separate locations in memory. where 2 variables become
    the same by copying the value but in 2 separate spots in the memory.
    *Features of call by value: Function arguments are always passed by value.
    It copies the value of a variable passed in a function to a local variable.
    Both these variables occupy separate locations in memory. Thus, if changes
    are made in a particular variable it does not affect the other one. Call by
    reference: Let’s say, we have an object stored in the variable “a”. The
    variable stores the location or the address where the object lives. Now we
    set b=a. Now that new variable “b” instead of pointing to a new location in
    the memory, points to the same location where “a” does. No new object is
    created, no copy is created. Both the variables point to the same object.
    This is like having 2 names. This is call by reference. It behaves quite
    differently from by value. All objects interact by reference. *Features of
    By reference: In JavaScript, all objects interact by reference. If an object
    is stored in a variable and that variable is made equal to another variable
    then both of them occupy the same location in memory. Changes in one object
    variable affect the other object variable.//

    4)HOW TO CONVERT THE STRING OF ANY BASE TO INTEGER IN JAVASCRIPT? In
    JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed
    in string parameter or value to an integer value itself. This function
    returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of
    parseInt() function. SYNTAX: parseInt(string_value, base)

    ///variable typing/// the type of a variable is determined only when a value
    is assigned and can change as the variable appears in different contexts.
    Usually, you don’t have to worry about the type; JavaScript figures out what
    you want and just does it.
